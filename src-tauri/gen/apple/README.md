# Generated Apple Project Files

This folder contains Xcode project files generated by Tauri for iOS/macOS builds.

## ⚠️ Important

**Most files in this folder are auto-generated and should NOT be committed to version control.**

### Exception: `tauri` Script

The `tauri` file is a wrapper script that bridges Xcode's build process with the Tauri CLI. This file **should** be committed because:

1. Xcode build scripts run `node tauri ios xcode-script` from this directory
2. Without this wrapper, Xcode cannot find the Tauri CLI
3. It's a workaround for the build system to locate `node_modules/.bin/tauri`

### Regenerating This Folder

If you need to regenerate the iOS project files:

```bash
# Initialize iOS project (first time)
npm run tauri ios init

# Or for development
npm run tauri ios dev
```

The `tauri` wrapper script should persist across regenerations.
